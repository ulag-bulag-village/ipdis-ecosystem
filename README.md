## License

* All Modules (`/avusen/`,  `/ip*/`) are licensed separately.
* All other utilities are licensed under [Apache 2.0](LICENSE-APACHE2).

The reason for the split-licensing is to ensure that for the vast majority of teams using IPIS to create feature-chains, then all changes can be made entirely in Apache2-licensed code, allowing teams full freedom over what and how they release and giving licensing clarity to commercial teams.
